  <h2>  Overview  </h2>
  <p>
  One of the best ways to understand music is by seeing it as a language. On the surface, it does not appear to be a profound anology.
Everyone already knows that music is a universal language in the sense that it can be incredibly expressive to those who overhear or engage in it.
But the metaphor extends far past the effects and usage of music. Seeing music as a language allows one to conceptualize its system and how
to be more proficient at music.	The process of being able to speak and understand a language is essentially learning building blocks (prononuciation, 
words, and vocabulary) and how to use them to your desire (grammar rules, application, and intuition). As a drummer/musician I see the equivalent 
of these two components for music being technical facility and musicality, respectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/wJTjjAXDZSY?t=44"> Here is a clip 
of Dave Grohl (drummer of Nirvana and lead member of the Foo Fighters) briefly mentioning the two components to explain why Ringo Starr was such a 
great musician. </a>   
  </p>
  
  <h2>
  Prononuciation, Words, and Vocabulary
  </h2>
  <p>
  The first part to both learning a language and to learning music is pronounication. For verbal language, its the process of learning how to make
the sounds of the letters or characters. For music, it can be learning how to make notes with your instruments or how to maneuver a pair of drumsticks.
From there, you learn words and phrases and how to put them together in basic ways. Similarly, with an instrument, you learn basic chords, scales, rhythms, 
and rudiments (see image). From the beginning to high-intermediate level in the learning process for both language and music, one spends their time mastering
these basics, progressively learning more and more complex vocabulary and sentence structures. They'll start reading and speaking the language or learning
and performing songs and pieces. Essentially, one will have to take on the already challenging task of building a large repoirtore before having to face
an even more abstract challenge that waits ahead of them: gaining the intuition to apply this repoirtore.

  <p>
  These 40 essential rudiments are the equivalent of scales and chords for drumming. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxke_nlcuw"> And here's someone playing them.</a>
  </p> 
  <h2>
  Grammar rules, Application, and Intuition
  </h2>
  <p>
  When mastering a language and music, there is a neccesity to actively develop an innate sense of what phrases sound right together and express what 
  you want them to express. Someone can study textbooks and memorize the written rules to a language all they want and still be unable to speak as 
  proficiently as someone who is surrounded by the language everyday. One must listen and read media and pop culture to gain an intuition on the 
  complex and unspoken connotations of certain words or sentence structure. From here, one can truly learn to articulate properly. Similarly with music, 
  one must listen to a ton of music and past musicians to strengthen their intuition on what notes, rhythms, and structures sound right so that they 
  too can produce expressive, provoking art. But of course, none of this could happen without the technical facility to back it up. This component is 
  often harder to develop because there is no direct indicator in how strong one's intuition is other than the art they produce. But once someone truly 
  starts internalizing and strengthening this sense, becoming 'better' at the language or the 'instrument' is about consistenly exploring new ideas 
  and learning more vocabulary to be even more expressive and truly be able to make their own unique footprint with what they write/say or what they perform. 
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qMazXHXnAU"> The analogy mentioned here, the relationship between the two components, and the knowledge that intuition 
  grants you is expalained pretty well in the first part of the video. </a>
